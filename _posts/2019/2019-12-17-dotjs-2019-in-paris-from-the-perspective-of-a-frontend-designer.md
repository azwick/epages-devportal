On December 5-6, 2019 me and two colleagues joined the [dotJS](https://www.dotjs.io/){:target="_blank"} conference in Paris, after we already attended the little sister conference [dotCSS](https://developer.epages.com/blog/events/a-russian-a-brazilian-and-a-german-at-the-dotcss-2019-in-paris/){:target="_blank"} a day before. 
Even the concept of both conferences was the same, there were some differences: there were many more sponsors, speakers and participants and the conference was two days long and split into two main topics. Day 1 was about Frontend development and day 2 was about Backend development with a focus on JavaScript as a language. With the concept of 18-minute talks one after the other, it was possible to attend all of the 20 talks without feeling exhausted, quite the contrary...

## My favorite talks

Even every talk of each speaker was wonderfully prepared and very professional, I have very clear my TOP 3 on which I would like to provide some details...

### #1 Charlie Gerard - Exploring the hidden potential of sound data

[Charlie's](https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie){:target="_blank"} talk was about machine learning in 'Using the rich properties of sound to gain insights about an activity or environment'. She demonstrated her topic in a very special way and showed us how a teachable machine recognizes different sounds for example coughing, typing or teeth brushing and how the collected data of a sound look. I mean, how often did you see someone teeth brushing on the stage to get a certain sound into a microphone in front of hundreds of people? That was fun to see and exciting for everyone when the teachable machine finally showed the action "teeth brushing". You could feel the tension in the room before the silence was replaced by loud applause. Chalie also introduced us to the application possibilities as well as to the limitations.

### #2 Chris Heilmann - Develop, Debug, Learn?

[Chris's](https://twitter.com/codepo8){:target="_blank"} talk was an answer to a long-standing question for me. As a Frontend Designer I would love to code some more, but every time I tried I failed right from the start. The first challenge always was deciding WHAT language or framework from this vast pool of possibilities I wanna try or learn. Followed by the second challenge to SET UP the environment on my own to even get started. And the third challenge, START CODING, was sometimes something I didn't achieve at all because I was already too frustrated. Therefore Chrisâ€™s talk was like a revelation to me. He talked about exactly these problems even it was from a different point of view. 

Chris explained first how he started as a developer. He took us back to the time where the focus was on 'Learn - Develop - Debug' in exactly this order and with the equivalent priority. He explained why it was so interesting to be a developer and which challenges he needed to solve especially when JavaScript came around. JavaScript changed everything and we more and more dependent ourselves on third party products. On the one hand, it easies up a quick development. On the other hand, it leads to over-engineering and sending more code to the devices than necessary. The focus changed to 'Depending' and 'Developing' with a bit of resource distribution on 'Debugging' and 'Learning'. Chris wants us not to think about ourselves, he wants us to think about everyone how uses our end-product. Beside 'Filling the needs', 'Adding quality' and 'Creating delight', he told us how important it is to learn and to know what exactly happens in the background of our written code. He introduced us to online editors which simplify our lives (e.g. [CodePen](https://codepen.io/){:target="_blank"}, [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/){:target="_blank"}, [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/?html,output){:target="_blank"}, ...) and documentations which broaden our horizon ([Mozilla Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/){:target="_blank"}, [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/){:target="_blank"}, ...). 
What I learn from this talk is, that I maybe should start writing a small application with JavaScript into CodePen before setting up an entire Flutter environment for writing an app! ðŸ˜¬

### #3 Sara Vieira - The complexity in simplicity

[Sara](https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW){:target="_blank"} managed to captivate the crowd within a very short time with her energy charged attitude. She provided exciting and funny 18 minutes before she been also asked questions by moderator [Christophe Porteneuve](https://twitter.com/porteneuve){:target="_blank"}. Her talk was literally about complexity in simplicity starting with a button and the '100 different things' you can actually do with a single button. She continued the topic of input fields, mentioned the accessibility and the problem of not translated placeholders. After reminding mainly designers, that placeholders are NOT labels, she showed us her opinion about Custom Selects, which you can find [here](https://doineedacustomselect.com){:target="_blank"}... ðŸ˜„ Interesting was also her solution to easily get the type of a credit card with RegEx. Her outcome of the talk was to let us take the burden so that the users don't have to and to cut back on the design to improve the UX because 'Your pretty code won't make your users come back'.

## Summary

To attend the dotJS was worthwhile in every respect. The concept of having 18-minutes talks is an awesome concept to be attentive all the time. Even as a designer, every talk was easy to follow and interesting. (And if something wasn't that exciting, then it was only 18 minutes... ðŸ˜‰)
